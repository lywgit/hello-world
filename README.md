# Hello World

Hello!

Starting this page as a practice.

Hope to get familiar with git.

## Testing commit 

lywgit is my git account, lywang is also me.
 
Commit through https will be prompted to enter git username (lywgit) and password. 
(Starting from the second time, the credential.helper=osxkeychain will help)
Although the global git setup is user.name=lywang, the commit shows lywgit instead.
