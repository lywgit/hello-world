# Hello World

Hello!

This repo started as a practice to get familiar with git. Now I use it to expreiment with github.


## Experiment Log

### ipython notebook (2018-09-05)
 
* Upload an [ipython notebook](jupyter_notebook/notebook_on_github.ipynb). It is rendered on github. But the loading speed is a bit slow.
* The nbviewer site does this faster. Simply supply the url of the notebook on github will do. The same file can be viewed more quickly [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lywgit/hello-world/blob/master/jupyter_notebook/notebook_on_github.ipynb). 


## Note 

### Commit Author Name

* "lywgit" is my git account name, some earlier commits of "lywang" is also me (committed with my other emails which I now add to my profile. So they show up as lywgit as well)
