# Hello World

Hello!

Starting this page as a practice.

Hope to get familiar with git.

I also use this repo as a place to try out git.

## Commit Author Name

* "lywgit" is my git account name, some earlier commits of "lywang" is also me (committed with my other emails which I now add to my profile. So they show up as lywgit as well)
