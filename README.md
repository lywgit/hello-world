# Hello World

Hello!

This repo started as a practice to get familiar with git. Now I use it to expreiment with github.


## Experiments

### Commit Author Name

* "lywgit" is my git account name, some earlier commits of "lywang" is also me (committed with my other emails which I now add to my profile. So they show up as lywgit as well)
